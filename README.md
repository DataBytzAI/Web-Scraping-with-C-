Webscraping with C#

When we think of different sources of data, we generally think about structured or semi-structured data presented to us in SQL, Web-services, CSV, etc.... however, there is a huge volume of data out there thats not available to us in these nice easily parsable formats and a lot of that data resides and is presented to us via websites. The problem with data in websites however is that generally the data is not presented to us in an easy to get at manner. Normally it is mashed up and mixed in a blend of css and html. The job of web-scraping, is to go under the hood, and extract data from websites using code automation, so that we can get it into a format we can work with.
